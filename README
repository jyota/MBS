Concepts, approach, hybrid feature selection, and modified bagging schema are defined in Darius Dziuda's 2010 "Data Mining for Genomics & Proteomics" book.
R code by Jyota Snyder (jyotas at my dot ccsu dot edu).

Eventually this package will be more documented in the man files for the package.
This is basically a package version of the FeatureSelection repo I have, but I also optimized this with Rcpp and can do parallel bootstrapping.
