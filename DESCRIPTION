Author: Darius Dziuda, Jyota Snyder
Maintainer: Jyota Snyder <jyotas@my.ccsu.edu>
Description: This package implements the modified bagging schema and stepwise hybrid feature selection as defined in Darius Dziuda's 2010 book "Data Mining for Genomics & Proteomics." The approach was designed for feature selection and biomarker discovery in gene expression datasets having a large number of variables. Ensemble based classification estimates are calculated based on LDA models trained on in-bag data and tested on out-of-bag data for a chosen number of experiments.
